            The installer security screen will allow for basic password protection on the installer. The password is set at package creation time.  The password
            input on this screen must be entered before proceeding with an install.   This setting is optional and can be turned on/off via the package creation screens.
            <br/><br/>

            If you do not recall the password then login to the site where the package was created and click the details of the package to view the original password.
            To validate the password just typed you can toggle the view by clicking on the lock icon.	For detail on how to override this setting visit the online FAQ for
            <a href="https://snapcreek.com/duplicator/docs/faqs-tech/#faq-installer-030-q" target="_blankopen_section">more details</a>.

                    <td>
                        "Locked" means a password is protecting each step of the installer.  This option is recommended on all installers
                        that are accessible via a public URL but not required.

                    <td>
                        "Unlocked" means that if your installer is on a public server that anyone can access it.  This is a less secure way to run your installer. If you are running the
                        installer very quickly then removing all the installer files, then the chances of exposing it is going to be low depending	on your sites access history.
                        <br/><br/>

                        While it is not required to	have a password set it is recommended.  If your URL has little to no traffic or has never been the target of an attack
                        then running the installer without a password is going to be relatively safe if ran quickly.  However, a password is always a good idea.  Also, it is
                        absolutely required and recommended to remove <u>all</u> installer files after installation is completed by logging into the WordPress admin and
                        following the Duplicator prompts.

            </table>
            <br/>
            Note: Even though the installer has a password protection feature, it should only be used for the short term while the installer is being used. All installer files should and
            must be removed after the install is completed.  Files should not to be left on the server for any long duration of time to prevent any security related issues.

            <br/><br/>


            Step 1 of the installer is separated into four sections for pro and three for lite.  Below is an overview of each area:
            <br/><br/>

            <h3>Archive</h3>
            This is the archive file the installer must use in order to extract the web site files and database.   The 'Name' is a unique key that
            ties both the archive and installer together.   The installer needs the archive file name to match the 'Name' value exactly character for character in order
            for	this section to get a pass status.
            <br/><br/>
            If the archive name	is ever changed then it should be renamed back to the 'Name' value in order for the installer to properly identify it as part of a
            complete package.  Additional information such as the archive size and the package notes are mentioned in this section.
            <br/><br/>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            This section shows the installers system requirements and notices.  All requirements must pass in order to proceed to Step 2.  Each requirement will show
            a <b class="dupx-pass">Pass</b>/<b class="dupx-fail">Fail</b> status.  Notices on the other hand are <u>not</u> required in order to continue with the install.
            <br/><br/>

            Notices are simply checks that will help you identify any possible issues that might occur.  If this section shows a
            <b class="dupx-pass">Good</b>/<b class="dupx-fail">Warn</b> for various checks. 	Click on the title link and	read the overview for how to solve the test.
            <br/><br/>

            <h3>Multisite <sup>pro</sup></h3>
            The multisite option allows users with a Pro Business or Gold license to perform additional multi-site tasks.  All licenses can backup & migrate standalone sites
            and full multisite networks. Multisite Plus+ (business and above) adds the  ability to install a subsite as a standalone site.
            <br/><br/>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            The options for step 1 can help better prepare your site should your server need additional settings beyond most general configuration.
            <table class="help-opt">
                <tr>
                    <th class="col-opt">Option</th>
                    <th>Details</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2" class="section">General Options</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="col-opt">Extraction</td>
                    <td>
                        <b>Manual Archive Extraction</b><br/>
                        Set the Extraction value to "Manual Archive Extraction" when the archive file has already been manually extracted on the server.  This can be done through your hosts
                        control panel such as cPanel or by your host directly. This setting can be helpful if you have a large archive files or are having issues with the installer extracting
                        the file due to timeout issues.
                        <br/><br/>

                        <b>PHP ZipArchive</b><br/>
                        This extraction method will use the PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php" target="_blank">ZipArchive</a> code to extract the archive zip file.
                        <br/><br/>

                        <b>Shell-Exec Unzip</b><br/>
                        This extraction method will use the PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.shell-exec.php" target="_blank">shell_exec</a> to call the system unzip
                        command on the server.  This is the default mode that is used if its avail on the server.
                        <br/><br/>

                        is having issues.  These options should only be used if you run into issues after you have tried to run an install.

                <tr>
                    <td class="col-opt">Config Files </td>
                    <td>
                        When dealing with configuration files (.htaccess, web.config and .user.ini) the installer can apply different modes:
                        <br/><br/>

                        <b>Create New:</b> This is the default recommended option which will create either a new .htaccess or web.config file.  The new file is streamlined to help
                        guarantee no conflicts are created during install.   The config files generated with this mode will be simple and basic.  The WordFence .user.ini file if
                        present will be removed.
                        <br/><br/>

                        <b>Restore Original:</b> This option simply renames the .htaccess__[HASH] or web.config.orig	files to .htaccess or web.config. The *.orig files come from the original
                        web server where the package was built.	Please note this option will cause issues with the install process if the configuration files are not properly setup to
                        handle the new server environment.  This is an	advanced option and should only be used if you know how to properly configure your web servers configuration.
                        <br/><br/>

                        <b>Ignore All:</b> This option simply does nothing.  No files are backed up, nothing is renamed or created.  This advanced option assumes you already have your
                        config files setup and know how they should behave in the new environment.  When the package is build it will always create a .htaccess__[HASH] or web.config.orig.
                        Since these files are already in the archive file they will show up when the archive is extracted.
                        <br/><br/>

                        <b>Additional Notes:</b>
                        Inside the archive.zip will be a copy of the original .htaccess (Apache) or the web.config (IIS) files that were setup with your packaged site.  They are both
                        renamed to .htaccess__[HASH] and web.config.orig.  When using either 'Create New' or 'Restore Original' any existing config files  will	be backed up with a .bak extension.
                        <i>None of these changes are made until Step 3 is completed, to avoid any issues the .htaccess might cause during the install</i>

                        The level of detail that will be sent to the log file (installer-log.txt).  The recommend setting for most installs should be 'Light'.
                        Note if you use Debug the amount of data written can be very large.  Debug is only recommended for support.

            <h3>Notices</h3>
            To proceed with the install users must check the checkbox labeled " I have read and accept all terms &amp; notices".   This means you accept the term of using the software
            and are aware of any notices.

                        control panel and create the database.  If your host supports 'cPanel' then you can use this option to create a new database after logging in via your
                        cPanel account.

                        be a valid WordPress installed database.  This option is viable when you need to run advanced search and replace options on the database.

            <b>Review Install Report</b><br/>
            The install report is designed to give you a synopsis of the possible errors and warnings that may exist after the installation is completed.
            <br/><br/>

            <b>Test Site</b><br/>
            After the install is complete run through your entire site and test all pages and posts.
            <br/><br/>

            <b>Final Security Cleanup</b><br/>
            When completed with the installation please delete all installation files.  <b>Leaving these files on your server can be a security risk!</b>   You can remove
            all these files by logging into your WordPress admin and following the remove notification links or by deleting these file manually.   Be sure these files/directories are removed.  Optionally
            it is also recommended to remove the archive.zip/daf file.

                <b>Common Quick Fix Issues:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a <a href='https://snapcreek.com/wordpress-hosting/' target='_blank'>Duplicator approved hosting provider</a></li>
                    <li>Validate directory and file permissions (see below)</li>
                    <li>Validate web server configuration file (see below)</li>
                    <li>Clear your browsers cache</li>
                    <li>Deactivate and reactivate all plugins</li>
                    <li>Resave a plugins settings if it reports errors</li>
                    <li>Make sure your root directory is empty</li>
                </ul>

                <b>Permissions:</b><br/>
                Not all operating systems are alike.  Therefore, when you move a package (zip file) from one location to another the file and directory permissions may not always stick.  If this is the case then check your WordPress directories and make sure it's permissions are set to 755. For files make sure the permissions are set to 644 (this does not apply to windows servers).   Also pay attention to the owner/group attributes.  For a full overview of the correct file changes see the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress#File_permissions' target='_blank'>WordPress permissions codex</a>
                <br/><br/>

                <b>Web server configuration files:</b><br/>
                For Apache web server the root .htaccess file was copied to .htaccess__[HASH]. A new stripped down .htaccess file was created to help simplify access issues.  For IIS web server the web.config file was copied to web.config.orig, however no new web.config file was created.  If you have not altered this file manually then resaving your permalinks and resaving your plugins should resolve most all changes that were made to the root web configuration file.   If your still experiencing issues then open the .orig file and do a compare to see what changes need to be made. <br/><br/><b>Plugin Notes:</b><br/> It's impossible to know how all 3rd party plugins function.  The Duplicator attempts to fix the new install URL for settings stored in the WordPress options table.   Please validate that all plugins retained there settings after installing.   If you experience issues try to bulk deactivate all plugins then bulk reactivate them on your new duplicated site. If you run into issues were a plugin does not retain its data then try to resave the plugins settings.
                <br/><br/>

                 <b>Cache Systems:</b><br/>
                 Any type of cache system such as Super Cache, W3 Cache, etc. should be emptied before you create a package.  Another alternative is to include the cache directory in the directory exclusion path list found in the options dialog. Including a directory such as \pathtowordpress\wp-content\w3tc\ (the w3 Total Cache directory) will exclude this directory from being packaged. In is highly recommended to always perform a cache empty when you first fire up your new site even if you excluded your cache directory.
                 <br/><br/>

                 <b>Trying Again:</b><br/>
                 If you need to retry and reinstall this package you can easily run the process again by deleting all files except the installer and package file and then browse to the installer again.
                 <br/><br/>

                 <b>Additional Notes:</b><br/>
                 If you have made changes to your PHP files directly this might have an impact on your duplicated site.  Be sure all changes made will correspond to the sites new location.
                 Only the package (zip file) and the installer (php file) should be in the directory where you are installing the site.  Please read through our knowledge base before submitting any issues.
                 If you have a large log file that needs evaluated please email the file, or attach it to a help ticket.
